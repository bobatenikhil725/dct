In Transform coding, image is transformed into different domain from spatial domain and then the transformed coefficients are encoded. Transform coding helps to get high data compression at the expense of higher computational requirement. There are various transforms but DCT is considered superior because (a)It has better energy compaction(b)It is faster(c)It is optimized (d)It is not signal dependent

# The discrete cosine transform 
(DCT) converts image in spatial domain to frequency domain. In DCT the rows of the N Ã— N transform matrix C are obtained as a function of cosines. The amount of variation increases as we move down the rows. Formula for 2D DCT is given in Fig
